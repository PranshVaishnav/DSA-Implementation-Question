* Heap is a Complete Binary Tree
* Heap can contain Duplicates.
* Every Node should have an element greater than or equal to its descendent--> MAX HEAP
* Every Node should have an element smaller than or equal to its descendent--> MIN HEAP
* Heap is normally stored in array for faster operation.

*  Arr[(i-1)/2]	Returns the parent node
   Arr[(2*i)+1]	Returns the left child node
   Arr[(2*i)+2]	Returns the right child node
